This logic doesn't belong\n\tin your application code, your backbone models, or anywhere else but the presentation layer. The templating\n\tlanguage is a good place to put this.\n\n- **Reusable view helpers are super fun and helpful.**\n\tRails had the right idea by shipping a bunch of view helpers with ActionView. Having commonly used view helpers\n\tcome bundled with the framework keeps developers from spending time writing them (and testing them, or even worse,\n\t_not testing them_) again and again.\n\n- **Keep the core library light.**\n\tWhile **walrus** ships with a bunch of filters and helpers you can use out-of-the-box, only the essentials\n\tare included in the core. This keeps client-side code as small as it can be, letting you opt-in to extras\n\tonly as often as you need them. To extend **walrus** with new filters and helpers, just include the\n\tjavascript you want and you're done, son.\n\n- **Stop hashing and slashing.**\n\tMaybe it's just me, but opening and closing blocks with \"hash-something\" \"slash-something\" feels super redundant.\n\tWalrus uses do/end for its blocks, which should look a lot more familiar to ruby types.\n\nThe **walrus** parser is written in [jison][jison] and the rest in [coffeescript][coffeescript], and everything\nis tested with [mocha][mocha]. **Walrus has no runtime dependencies.**\n\nSince **walrus** is still pretty young, expect changes in the API, especially for filters and helpers.\n\nThe `/test/examples` directory is filled with plenty of self-documenting examples that comprise over half of\nthe test suite, so give those a once-over if you have a question that isn't answered in the readme.\n\n## Core\n\nThe **walrus** core contains the walrus parser/compiler, several common helpers and filters, and a few internal utility methods.\n\n### Usage in JavaScript\n\nLike other [jison][jison]-based parsers, templating with **walrus** is a two-step process.\n\nFirst, grab your template and parse it:\n\n``` js\nvar template = Walrus.Parser.parse( $( '#my-template' ).html( ) );\n```\n\n`template` is a JavaScript object ready to accept a view object and kick out some text.\n\n``` js\nvar htmlGoodness = template.compile( { data : 'foo bar baz' } );\n```\n\n### Paths\n\nLike some of the other templating solutions out there, Walrus will let you reference members using object paths.\n\nIf your view object is:\n\n``` json\n{\n\t\"hello\" :\n\t{\n\t\t\"walrus\" : \"sweeet.\"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThen `{{hello.walrus}}` will resolve to `sweeet.`.\n\n### Root References (all day erryday)\n\nWith Walrus, you can always reference the root view object as a path context by using the `@` symbol before your path.\nUse this even if you're dereferenced, iterating, or even within the arguments to a method.\n\nSo if you've got a view object like:\n\n``` json\n{\n\t\"team\" : \"Detroit Red Wings\",\n\t\"players\" :\n\t[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\" : \"Pavel Datsyuk\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\" : \"Nicklas Lidström\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"name\" : \"Darren Helm\"\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\nYou can create your badass hockey roster like:\n\n``` html\n<ul>\n\t{{:each players do}}\n\t<li>{{name}} plays for the {{@team}}</li>\n\t{{end}}\n</ul>\n```\n\n### (Un-)Escaping\n\nLike many other mustache-like languages, **walrus** escapes string members by default in an attempt\nto get rid of HTML-unsafe characters.\n\nIf you want these characters included, use an equals sign before your expression, like: `{{=html}}`.\n\n### Methods\n\nOne of the main focuses of Walrus is to treat methods on your view object like first-class citizens. You can\ncall your methods with any number of arguments from the view object or (most) javascript literals.\n\nWith a view object like:\n\n``` js\n{\n\t\"captitalize\" : function( str ){ return str.charAt( 0 ).toUpperCase( ) + str.slice( 1 ); },\n\t\"city\" : \"detroit\"\n}\n```\n\nIt's as easy as `{{capitalize( city )}}`.\n\n> Note that since both of these members are at the root of the view object, you could also reference them like\n> `{{@capitalize( @city )}}`, or any combination of local or root references.\n\n## Core Blocks/Helpers\n\nIn Walrus, blocks don't look like the `#member`/`/member` hash/slash pairs we've seen elsewhere. Walrus looks\na lot more like ruby and uses a simpler `do`/`end` idiom.\n\nEach block has a helper, preceded by `:`, that tells you what the block does. Walrus ships with a basic set of\nthese built in.\n\n### :if and :unless\n\nConditionals can be represented by `:if` and `:unless` blocks. Both of these test the expression for truthiness\nor falsiness respectively.\n\n``` html\n{{:if @loggedIn do}}\n<p>Welcome back, {{@username}}!</p>\n{{end}}\n\n{{:unless @loggedIn do}}\n<p>I don't believe we've met!</p>\n{{end}}\n```\n\n### :each\n\n`:each` can be used to iterate over a collection.\n\n``` html\n{{:each @player do}}\n<li>{{name}}</li>\n{{end}}\n```\n\n> While in an `:each` block, you can use the following special variables:\n>\n> **$index** provides the index of the current item in the collection\n>\n> **$length** provides the length of the collection\n>\n>\t**$parent** provides access to the parent object of the collection\n>\n> Like several other templating solutions, you can implicitly iterate over a collection of values, like strings, and template in the current value with `{{.}}`.\n\n### :with\n\n`:with` can be used to force a change in context if you don't want to use tons of object paths.\n\n``` html\n{{:with @team.captain do}}\n<p>Captain: {{name}}</p>\n{{end}}\n```\n\n> While in a `:with` block, you can use the following special variables:\n>\n> **$parent** provides access to the parent object of the context\n\n## Core Filters\n\nWalrus also supports the concept of filters, which look a lot like filters you might have used in [liquid][liquid] or [ejs][ejs] templates.\n\nFilters also are preceded by `:`, but come after the main expression separated by a pipe, like `{{name | :upcase}}`.\n\nFilters can be chained together, separated by whitespace. Filters can be used with block helpers or in a standalone expression.\n\n### :equals\n\n`:equals` tests the expression for strict equality. This is most useful with the conditional block helpers.\n\n``` html\n{{:if status | :equals( 'pending' ) do}}\n<p>We're still working on it.</p>\n{{end}}\n```\n\n### :if\n\nReturns the expression if _condition_ is truthy, or nothing if _condition_ is falsy.\n\nParameters:\n\n\tcondition - the condition to test against\n\nUsage:\n\n\t{{ 'active' | :if( true ) }} <!-- \"active\" -->\n\n### :unless\n\nReturns the expression if _condition_ is falsy, or nothing if _condition_ is truthy.\n\nParameters:\n\n\tcondition - the condition to test against\n\nUsage:\n\n\t{{ 'active' | :unless( true ) }} <!-- \"\" -->\n\n### :or\n\n`:or` can be used to provide a default or fallback value if a member doesn't exist on your view object.\n\n``` html\n<h2>{{price | :or( 'N/A' )}}</h2>\n```\n\n### :log\n\n`:log` is a helper method for developers that simply passes its argument to the console.\n\n``` html\nYou can log a {{@member | :log}} of the view object,\nwhile {{. | :log}} will log the whole thing,\nand {{\"arbitrary literals\" | :log}} can be logged, too!\n```\n\n### :as\n\nDecorates a view object or collection of view objects with custom domain methods.\n\nParameters:\n\n\tname - The key for the object on `Walrus.Domain` to decorate with\n\nUsage:\n\nFirst, define some custom domain methods:\n\n``` js\nWalrus.Domain.person = { fullName : function( ){ return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName; } };\n```\n\nThen, selectively apply those to your view object at template-time:\n\n``` html\n<ul>\n\t{{:each employee | :as( 'person' ) do}}\n\t<li>{{fullName}}</li>\n\t{{do}}\n</ul>\n```\n\n## Walrus.Collections\n\n`walrus.collections` contains helpers and filters that are useful when working with arrays.\n\n### :first\n\nSelects the first _count_ items of the array. Defaults to only the first item.\n\nParameters:\n\n\tcount - Optional: how many items to include\n\nUsage:\n\n``` html\n{{ :each numbers | :first do }}\n\t<!-- 1 -->\n{{ end }}\n\n{{ :each numbers | :first( 5 ) do }}\n\t<!-- 1 2 3 4 5 -->\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n### :last\n\nSelects the last _count_ items of the array. Defaults to only the last item.\n\nParameters:\n\n\tcount - Optional: how many items to include\n\nUsage:\n\n``` html\n{{ :each numbers | :last do }}\n\t<!-- 10 -->\n{{ end }}\n\n{{ :each numbers | :last( 5 ) do }}\n\t<!-- 6 7 8 9 10 -->\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n### :after\n\nSelects all of the items in the array except for the first _count_.\n\nParameters:\n\n\tcount - how many items to omit from the beginning\n\nUsage:\n\n``` html\n{{ :each numbers | :after( 3 ) do }}\n\t<!-- 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -->\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n### :before\n\nSelects all of the items in the array except for the last _count_.\n\nParameters:\n\n\tcount - how many items to omit from the end\n\nUsage:\n\n``` html\n{{ :each numbers | :before( 3 ) do }}\n\t<!-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -->\n{{ end }}\n```\n\n### :count\n\nReturns the length of the given array.\n\nParameters: none\n\nUsage:\n\n``` html\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];\n\n{{ numbers | :count }} <!-- 5 -->\n```\n\n### :any\n\nReturns true if the array is not empty. Opposite of `:empty`.\n\nParameters: none\n\nUsage:\n\n``` html\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];\n\n{{ numbers | :any }} <!-- true -->\n```\n\n### :empty\n\nReturns true of the array is empty. Opposite of `:any`.\n\nParameters: none\n\nUsage:\n\n``` html\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];\n\n{{ numbers | :empty }} <!-- false -->\n```\n\n### :in_groups_of\n\nSplits the given array into sub-arrays with at most `count` items apiece\n\nParameters:\n\n  count - the number of items to be placed in each group\n\nUsage:\n\n``` html\nvar numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];\n\n{{ :each numbers | :in_groups_of( 3 ) }}  <!-- [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5 ] ] -->\n```\n\n## Walrus.Currencies\n\n`walrus.currencies` contains helpers and filters that are useful when working with dolla bills.\n\n### :currency\n\nReturns a string formatted in the current locale's format.\nDelegates to [accounting.js](http://josscrowcroft.github.com/accounting.js/) if present.\n\nParameters:\n  symbol - (Optional) the currency symbol to use\n\tprecision - (Optional) the decimal place level to show cents\n\tdecimal - (Optional) the character used to delimit decimals\n\tthousand - (Optional) the character used to delimit thousands\n\nUsage:\n\n\t{{ 36000 | :currency }} // => $36,000.00\n\t{{ 36000 | :currency( '$', 0 ) }} // => $36,000\n\n## Walrus.Dates\n\n`walrus.dates` contains helpers and filters that are useful when working with dates or timestamps.\n\n### :strftime\n\nFormats a date into the string given by `format`.
